<!-- 4. What is overloading-->

When we used to share our logic, design,patern to create same function pass with different arguments that's called method overloading.
WHen we used to pass data using same function ,differnts arguments or parameterthat is called methd overloading.

note:: In php method overloading generate warning.
overloading methods must be defined as public.


example::
<?php
class Calculator
{

     public function add($numbers)
     {
        $sum = 0;
        foreach ($numbers as $number)
         {
            $sum += $number;
        }
        return $sum;
    }
}
?>
