<!--8.How to load class in php-->

1. first of all you create one php file and define your class(classname),

example::
class MyClass
 {
    public function display() 
    {
        echo "MyClass instance created!";
    }
} 
In example MyClass is class..

2. user also load thier class in php file in another file using require() or require_once() function.

if user create one file in .php formate , in this file user add other class file .

example::

// index.php (one class file)

// Include the another class file
{
require_once 'MyClass.php';
}

* user define class in php file
* Use require_once to include the class file in your script.
* Create an instance of the class and use it as needed.

3. create class using constructor::

Creating an Instance: After including Car.php, 
you can create an instance of the Car class using $myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');. This initializes an object ($myCar) of type Car, passing 'Toyota' as the brand and 'Corolla' as the model to the constructor.
