<!--11. what happen if constructer defined as private or public?_-->

IN OOPS have 3 different types of access specifiers.

1. public
2. private
3. protected

It is used to how can we are display our data in scope member function using private, public or protected.

Private:
If user define constructor as a PRIVATE intance of class it cant be generate any child class it self.

<?php

class Example
 {
    private function __construct() 
    {
        echo "Private constructor called.\n";
    }

    public static function createInstance() 
    {
        return new self();
    }
}
?>


* Protected::
When the constructor is protected, instances of PARENT CLASS cannot be directly created using CHILD CLASS from outside the class. However, the constructor can be called by child classes that extend PARENT CLASS.

example of protected class::

<?php

class ParentClass 
{
    protected function __construct()
     {
        echo "Protected constructor called.\n";
    }

    public static function createInstance() 
    {
        return new static();
    }
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass
 
?>
