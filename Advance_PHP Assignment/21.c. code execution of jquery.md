<!--21.c which is the starting point of  code execution of jquery.-->

IN j-query the staring point of execution around the '$(document).ready()' function.
this function ensures that the code inside it runs only after the dom ( document object model.)
has fully loaded, which is important because it ensures that all elements are available to be manipulated.

example::
$(document).ready(function() 
{
    console.log("The document is ready!");
});


you can use the shorthand version of $(document).ready():


$(function()
 {
    console.log("The document is ready!");
});
